Firstly : I am sorry for being late.
Secondly : I created Splash and Selected pages
Selected Page has two button :1- go to Register page.
                              2- go to Add Vehcile.
1- when Register without any empty field click on submit and go to login page.
2- when Add Vehcile without any empty field your adding is successed.

hint: I am being late because Internet and I do not give user permission to select image from his/her Gallery because all packeges made conflic with my SDK version.
So I put TextButton beside every image so when click on it I put specific image so I do not process selecting image in Fail or Success of Register or Add Vehcile.
